```bash
$ npm start 
```

This task will install all dependencies, build dev environment, monitor the source files, compile SASS to CSS and launch the browser. The task also includes [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/), so you no longer have to manually refresh your page after making changes! Make sure `API_URL` constant in [`gulp/const.js`](gulp/const.js) file points to your API back-end.

If you don't want to launch the browser when serving code then pass `--open=false` flag:

```bash
$ npm start -- --open=false
```

The build task include transpilation from ES6 to ES5, concatenation, minification, compression, asset revision, template cache, cdn etc. If there have been no errors when executing the build command, the build should be located in `build/dist` directory and this build is ready for uploading to the server! To initiate a full build, you simply run the follow task:
